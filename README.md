# claude-workflow

A Claude Code mod that runs a project from idea to pull request with one command, `/workflow`, and keeps a slice's tests locked between writing them and making them pass.

## Role in the system

It is the `workflow` half of the setup in [ilianusss/.claude](https://github.com/ilianusss/.claude), loaded there as a submodule, and it also installs on its own as a plugin. The knowledge it relies on (`writing-tests-first`, `writing-clean-code`, `writing-secure-code`, `following-git-conventions`) and the `reviewer` agent live in that repo; without them the phases still run, with less guidance.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code 2.1.308 or later. Mods use an early-access API that may change between releases.
- A git repository: the state lives in its `.git`.

## Getting started

At the prompt of a Claude Code session:

```text
/plugin install workflow --marketplace ilianusss/claude-workflow
```

Then, in a repo, type `/workflow new <title>`. A project without `.claude/workflow.json` starts with the setup phase, which writes it.

## Commands

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `/workflow` | The workflows of this repo |
| `/workflow all` | Open workflows in every repo |
| `/workflow new <title>` | Start one: size, commits and branch are asked in a dialog |
| `/workflow continue [slug]` | Resume one, with a drift check after a long break |
| `/workflow next` | Clear the context and continue: the command between slices |
| `/workflow pause` | Write the handoff and stop |
| `/workflow unlock <file> <reason>` | Unlock a locked test yourself |
| `/workflow done <slug>`, `/workflow abandon <slug> <reason>` | Close one |
| `/workflow adopt` | Set up a project, or rebuild workflows from their committed specs |

The phases, the slice cycle and the test lock are described in [docs/workflow.md](https://github.com/ilianusss/.claude/blob/main/docs/workflow.md) of the setup repo.

## Project structure

```text
hooks/        the module Claude Code loads
src/          commands, tools, guards, state, the test lock
phases/       what Claude does in each phase, with the files it may write
guides/       question banks, the decision guide, EARS, the drift check
templates/    spec, design, slices, ADR, project CLAUDE.md, workflow.json
tests/        claude plugin test suites, against a fake git and file system
```

## Documentation

- [docs/architecture.md](https://github.com/ilianusss/.claude/blob/main/docs/architecture.md) of the setup repo: how the mod enforces the lock and the gates, and the facts measured that shaped it.
- [docs/decisions.md](https://github.com/ilianusss/.claude/blob/main/docs/decisions.md): why it is built this way.

## Development

```sh
claude --plugin-dir .      # a session with the mod loaded, reloaded on save
claude plugin validate .   # what the engine would refuse
claude plugin test .       # the test suites
```

The engine writes the API types into `.claude-plugin/types/` each time it loads the mod; grep them rather than trusting memory, since the API moves between releases. A hook must be a function literal, at most one hook per event without a matcher, and `$` is never put in an object or handed to a callback: the engine refuses to load the module otherwise.
